# Vecno Mobile Wallet  
**Full-featured, secure mobile wallet for Android**

The Vecno Mobile Wallet is the official Android application for managing your Vecno funds on the go.

**Download it from Google Play:**  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vecnofoundation.vecnowallet  
(Developer: Vecno Foundation SA)

It provides an intuitive mobile interface to:

- Create or import multiple wallets
- View your balance and detailed transaction history
- Receive and send Vecno (VE)
- Generate and manage addresses (with support for named/fresh addresses to enhance privacy)
- Export transaction data (including links to vecnoscan.org for verification)

## Key Security Features

- **Full self-custody** - Your private keys and seed phrase never leave your device
- No data collection or sharing (as stated by the developer)
- Standard **BIP-39** seed phrases (12 or 24 words) for creation and recovery
- Device-level protection: Use your phone's biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID) or PIN/pattern for app access and transaction confirmation

> **Note:** The mobile wallet does not include a separate Payment Secret passphrase (unlike the desktop version). Sends are authorized securely through your device's built-in authentication methods.

## Why use the Mobile Wallet?

- Instant access on your phone - ideal for checking balances, quick payments, receiving mining rewards, or daily Vecno use
- Manage multiple wallets (e.g., one for spending, one for long-term holding)
- More convenient than paper wallets for frequent interactions
- Strong self-custody with straightforward seed-based recovery

## Step-by-Step: How to Get Started

### 1. Download & Install

- Open the Google Play Store on your Android device
- Search for **Vecno Wallet** or go directly to:  
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vecnofoundation.vecnowallet
- Install the app (verify it's published by **Vecno Foundation SA**)
- Launch the app and allow any required permissions (e.g., camera for QR code scanning)

### 2. Create or Import a Wallet

On first launch, select **New Wallet** (best for new users) or **Import Wallet**

**For Create New Wallet:**
- The app generates a 12- or 24-word BIP-39 seed phrase - your master recovery key.
- Write it down by hand on paper immediately. **Never screenshot, photograph, or store it digitally!**

**For Import Wallet:**
- Carefully enter your existing 12- or 24-word seed phrase (or private key if supported).

### Critical: Back up your seed phrase securely

**Never:**
- Take screenshots, photos, or save the seed phrase digitally (cloud, email, notes, etc.)
- Share it with anyone

**Recommended:**
- Store your handwritten seed phrase in multiple secure physical locations (fireproof safe, bank deposit box, split copies in trusted places)
- Enable biometric lock or a strong PIN for your device and app access
- Test recovery: Create a test wallet with a tiny amount, back up the seed, uninstall/reinstall the app (or use another device), then import to confirm it works

> **Handwritten offline backup of your seed phrase only** - keep it completely private and secure

### 3. Receive Vecno

- Navigate to the **Receive** tab/section
- Your Vecno address (starts with `vecno:`) appears - copy it or display the QR code
- Generate new or named addresses as needed to avoid reuse and improve privacy
- Share the address or QR code with senders (exchanges, mining pools, friends)

### 4. View Balance & Transactions

The main dashboard displays:

- Your total **VE** balance
- Recent transaction list (sends, receives, pending/confirmed)
- Details like amounts, fees, dates, transaction IDs, and vecnoscan.org links

Export options for history and records  
The wallet automatically syncs with the Vecno blockchain

### 5. Send Vecno (VE)

- Go to the **Send** tab/section
- Paste the recipient's address or scan a QR code using the camera
- Enter the amount
- Review details (amount, fees - tiny by default; option to boost for faster confirmation)
- Confirm and authorize using your device's PIN, fingerprint, or face ID
- Transaction is broadcast to the network

### 6. Import Wallet from Backup (Recovery)

- Select **Import Wallet** in the app
- Enter your 12- or 24-word seed phrase (or private key) exactly
- After syncing with the Vecno network, your balances, addresses, and full transaction history will appear

With self-custody and a secure seed phrase backup, your Vecno remains **fully under your control** - perfect for mobile use and device changes!
